# High-Performance Network Server

This is an implementation of a general-purpose HTTP network server, written in C and compatible with Linux and MacOS. It is built to scale well for large systems with high traffic, utilizing parallel processing and event-driven I/O multiplexing to fairly distribute server processing time and protect against DOS attacks.
